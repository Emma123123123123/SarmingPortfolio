        <b> Reflection: In this first episode from the Netflix series "The Playlist" shows the rise of the popular music streaming service Spotify.
            In the episode, we meet Daniel Ek, one of the founders of Spotify, who develops the idea to create a better music-streaming platform that 
            allows the listening of music all over the world while compensating artists and maintaining a legal relationship with the music industry. 
            Throughout the episode, Daniel faces a number of obstacles, including obtaining the rights to play music, but he stays persistent and determined, 
            even reaching out to Per Sudin, the president of Sony Music Sweden. Nevertheless, Daniel enrages Per Sudin, who feels that free music endangers 
            the artistic integrity and means of subsistence for artists in the industry. Daniel Ek, in my opinion, was a mirror of how a person's willpower 
            can enable them to navigate a challenging environment, no matter how dark or shallow it may be. Furthermore, Martin Lorentzon, his spouse, is a 
            person who perseveres in the face of difficulty and uncertainty. He appears to me as a perfect example of what a good friend is.The episode's plot 
            was well-organized, entertaining, and clearly stated. This episode, in my opinion, effectively and beautifully blends fiction and fact to 
            illustrate the inspiration for the founding of Spotify. In addition, I thought the scenes and the cinematography were well done and i was 
            amazed by the whole thing. I believe that the way the colors were shown also affected our perceptions of the events that were occurring. 
            The main topics of this episode were also pertinent to contemporary concerns, such as the difficulty of embracing and implementing creativity 
            and transformation in the world, the difficulty of trust, and the problem of elder generations having misgivings about the ability of younger 
            generations. All in all i enjoyed the episode well and it felt like a whole movie.
