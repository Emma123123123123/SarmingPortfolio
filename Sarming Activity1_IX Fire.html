    <strong>About this student</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
        I am Julianne Micah B. Sarming, i am 14 years old going 15 this November 07. I am from Jawa Valencia, living with a family of 4; this includes me, my brother, my mother, and lastly my father.
        I am sometimes dependent on others and thats a negative side of me, but i do try to be independent. Communicating with others is hard and when i do want to ask a question i get to scared and 
        at the end i regret not asking, especially in class. I do sports mostly Vollyball but unfortunately i rarely play because of homeworks or school activities.
        (below are my hobbies)

        <li>And lastly play online games</li>
    </i>
    </ul>
